  sub prio. (figure out relationship between minimum amount of points and maximum concentration grid size?)
    - roughly 2^17 points needed for 64x64 grid to run without problems. 2^16 can also work but is prone to breaking.
    from here they follow a patterns of roughly being able to double points while doubling area i.e. 128x128 with 2^18 points, but at some points you need to more than double.
Add error analysis (All of task B)
Perform Engineering simulation once full code is done
  sub prio. (Possibly animate again for the lulz)
