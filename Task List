re-implementing plotting actual dots, not concentration field
1D problem
Fix concentration field to show correct locations 
  sub prio. (figure out relationship between minimum amount of points and maximum concentration grid size?)
Pretty up plots with titles etc.
Create import file and import it
  sub prio. (Possibly other more fancy GUI if time is found)
Add error analysis (All of task B)
Perform Engineering simulation once full code is done
  sub prio. (Possibly animate again for the lulz)

  sub prio. Make rectangular data files importable
