  sub prio. (figure out relationship between minimum amount of points and maximum concentration grid size?)
    - roughly 2^17 points needed for 64x64 grid to run without problems. 2^16 can also work but is prone to breaking.
    from here they follow a patterns of roughly being able to double points while doubling area i.e. 128x128 with 2^18 points, but at some points you need to more than double.
